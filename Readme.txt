accesories, drugs stores, restaurants, etc. My team is Team-9 and there are total 4 members: Hoang Ngoc Anh Duc, Hoang Ngoc Duan, Tran Chan Nam
and Le Anh Tuan. In the mall homepage, the users can register member accounts and sign in the page to earn many benefits such as VIP members,
sale-off events. Moreover, the users can using a search tool-bar to search their favourite store to locate. Those store page allowed the users to view a lists
of items that the user can find and buy them by using "search" tool-bars. After adding an item to online cart, the user will have two option: continue buying
or purchasing their goods. Those are some overall functions that our team's two main can provide to the users now. After many studying appointment,
